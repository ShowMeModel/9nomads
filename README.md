# 6nomads
A machine learning project for 6nomands

## Task

The task at hand is a multi-class classification problem, for which both a training and a test set 
are provided as `.csv` files. You have to classify _last column_ that contains _4_ classes: `[0,1,2,3]`.

Work on this classification task by building a classifier only with the training data 
(downloadable here - [train.csv](https://app.6nomads.com/ml/train.csv) file), with the goal of 
achieving the best performance possible on the validation data (downloadable here - 
[test.csv](https://app.6nomads.com/ml/test.csv)). 

Problem should be solved using either Python or R.

Add a short writeup with your observations about the problem, your thought process 
throughout your work with it, any interesting findings you have and, finally, a descriptions 
of the results you have obtained. We would also like to get any code you write for this project, 
and would appreciate it if it was informally commented so that its easier to read for us.

We would appreciate if you can use some kind of interactive development environment 
e.g. Jupyter Notebook that contains the writeup, some plots if necessary along with the code. 
In this case you can send us either `.html` or `.ipynb` file.

## Solution

### AutoML

#### Python

#### R

### Classical machine learning
